<h1 align="center">Social Network Server</h1>

Project uses [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and [Typeorm](https://typeorm.io/).

# Scenario

You are making the RESTful API for next social network application!
To kick things off, your product owner has asked you to begin working on features to allow users to follow other users. Sounds simple, right?

# User stories

0. As a user, I can register a new account with email, username, password.
1. As a registered user, I can login with username / email & password.
2. As a forgetful user, I want to be able to request a password reset email.
3. As a user, I should receive an email with a secure link to reset my password.
4. As a logged-in user, I want to be able to view and update my user profile information.
5. As a logged-in user, I want to be able to log out of my account.
6. As a logged-in user, I can follow/unfollow another user.
7. As a logged-in user, I can view my following.
8. As a logged-in user, I can view my followers.
9. As a logged-in user, I can view my new followers in current month.
10. As a logged-in user, I can view top 10 users with most followers.

**What Does Following and Followers Mean?**
  - Following refers to the list of users that you follow.
  - Followers are the users that follow you.
